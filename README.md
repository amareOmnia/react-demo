# react-demo

This is a demo site I'm using to learn/practice React in frontend web development. All javascript files were written by me, while most css layout files were pre-made by Wes Bos. It emulates a storefront that uses Firebase to keep a live database of fish inventories and orders.

# Local Installation

Only `npm` is needed to run locally, and must be used to install dependencies. In the site directory, use: <br> <br>
`npm install` <br> <br>
Once that is completed, the custom command `npm run watch` will do two things: <br>
- create a local webserver (localhost:3000) to open in the default browser
- monitor both CSS and JS files for changes, and refresh site upon each file save

# Upcoming

- Security validations
- Improved animations
